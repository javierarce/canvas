# Corcho

Corcho (/ˈkoɾt͡ʃo/) is a tool that creates and sync web slideshows using the contents of a Figma file. You can then use GitHub Pages to host your slideshow on the web and have it automatically updated using GitHub Actions.

## How to run Corcho

1. Create a file in Figma and your slides as frames.
2. Create a non-expiring [Figma personal access token](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).
3. Copy the file id of your Figma file (which is the string of random alphanumeric characters found in the URL after `figma.com/file`)

### On GitHub Pages

1. Fork this project and add two secrets:

- `FIGMA_FILE`: with the file id.
- `FIGMA_TOKEN`: with your Figma Personal Access Token.

2. Enable:

- GitHub pages for the `main` branch.
- The deploy workflow (by visiting the Actions tab).

#### Customization

By default the cronjob of the GitHub Action will run every hour on the hour, but you can change the scheduling to be more frequent. Here's an example of a job that gets executed every 5 minutes:

```
name: Cron
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/5 * * * *"
```

### Locally

1. Clone this project
2. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and update it:

- `FIGMA_FILE`: with the file id.
- `FIGMA_TOKEN`: with your Figma Personal Access Token.

3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Run the project with `yarn start` or `npm run start`
5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser using a local server.
